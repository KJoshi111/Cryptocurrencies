# Cryptocurrencies

In this Unit we are using our knowledge of unspervised Machine Learning, Panda, K-mean Algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, Plotly Express and hvplot.

## Purpose:

Our Client wants a list of tradable cryptocurrencies and wants to be able to pick them from a classification system:
1. Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
2. Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
3. Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
4. Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
5. Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

## Results:

### The original dataframe we imported before cleaning : 1252 Data rows.
